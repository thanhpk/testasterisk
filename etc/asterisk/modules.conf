; Any modules that need to be loaded before the Asterisk core has been
; initialized (just after the logger has been initialized) can be loaded
; using 'preload'. This will frequently be needed if you wish to map all
; module configuration files into Realtime storage, since the Realtime
; driver will need to be loaded before the modules using those configuration
; files are initialized.
;
; An example of loading ODBC support would be:
preload => res_odbc.so
preload => res_config_odbc.so
noload => chan_sip.so ; deprecated SIP module from days gone by
;
; If you want, load the GTK console right away.
; Don't load the KDE console since
; it's not as sophisticated right now.
